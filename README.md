# TODO-list-app
 Simple To-Do list app I created to learn jQuery during my intro to JavaScript course in CareerFoundry's full-stack web development bootcamp. It was a quick exercise we did in one session to get familiar with jQuery while building a commonly suggested project.

 I do hope to come back to this project someday to enhance its functionality and interface as I learn new things, and maybe even make it into a personalized app for my phone.
